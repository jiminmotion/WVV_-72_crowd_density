This might be a bit overkill. Note they do not have to only be generated for calls similar records can be generated for location updates as a device moves around. 

Here is an example, artificially generated JSON version of what a CDR looks like: 
 {
        "CALLING_MSISDN": "174N6KL4Z0",
        "CALL_RESULT": "ANSWERED",
        "CALL_TYPE": "VOICE",
        "CHARGE": 11.308333333333334,
        "END_TIME": 1584110185,
        "ID": "e711dc37-80e2-4fc8-942e-a3885b82faa4",
        "ORIGINATING": "HAM03",
        "RECEIVING_MSISDN": "1516LSJFVBC",
        "START_TIME": 1584108828,
        "TERMINATING": "DUS05"
    },

Also note the origin and termination are network devices Towers in this simplified example, it could also be a fixed line point like a city which is no use for us
